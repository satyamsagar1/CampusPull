        LinkMate started as a project by passionate students of{" "}
        <strong>ABES Institute of Technology</strong>. Our goal was simple –
        build a platform that connects students, alumni, and faculty together.
        We wanted to create a space where opportunities, mentorship, and
        resources are accessible to everyone.
